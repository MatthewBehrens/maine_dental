#X-corp HTML bootstrap theme in Rails

Hey all!

So I was working with a client and he wanted me to build just a simple company website page, but eventually wanted to scale it to have users/database info.


Instead of just building static html pages for him and having to scrap those once he did wanted to scale it, I decided to just start the whole project in Rails first and scale it as needed.


When I first met with him I wanted to show him an example of what could be done, even though he just wanted something very, very simple. So I took a Bootstrap theme and implemented it in Rails. The end product being what is here. This is a fully functioning example of a simple Rails website using bootstrap. Having implemented this bootstrap theme in Rails its now pretty simple to just add the pictures he wants and the text he wants and boom you are on your way. 


I decided to make this as kind of a starter template for a website, so If an eventual client wants something done fast, or just want to use this again in the future its fully possible. 

It is using Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5

The theme is completely free to use, as long as you keep the footer note "COPYRIGHT Â© 2016 | X-CORPORATION DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED BY: UICOOKIES.COM"

If you want to remove that at the bottom it is $12.00 for 5 domains or $20 for unlimited access as I do not own the actual theme.
